# Audit Report

I would like to express our gratitude to Mobi Automation for the opportunity to conduct this audit.

## Limitations

The purpose of this audit is to identify potential vulnerabilities, issues, and areas of improvement within the smart contract(s) provided. While every effort has been made to identify security risks and ensure the integrity of the code, a successful audit does not guarantee that the contract is free from vulnerabilities or immune to all attacks.

Smart contracts inherently operate in a complex and evolving ecosystem where new exploits and attack vectors are continually discovered. Additionally, changes made to the contract after the audit may introduce new risks not accounted for in this assessment.

The audit should be considered as one component of a comprehensive security strategy.
