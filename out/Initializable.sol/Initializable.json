Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect. The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each \\\"step\\\" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized. For example: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ``` contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {     function initialize() initializer public {         __ERC20_init(\\\"MyToken\\\", \\\"MTK\\\");     } } contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {         __ERC20Permit_init(\\\"MyToken\\\");     } } ``` TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}. CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity. [CAUTION] ==== Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized. An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed: [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding] ```\",\"events\":{\"Initialized(uint8)\":{\"details\":\"Triggered when the contract has been initialized or reinitialized.\"}},\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"stateVariables\":{\"_initialized\":{\"custom:oz-retyped-from\":\"bool\",\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\"},\"_initializing\":{\"details\":\"Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"v1-migrator/contracts/dependencies/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":\"Initializable\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[\":@openzeppelin/=v1-migrator/node_modules/@openzeppelin/\"]},\"sources\":{\"v1-migrator/contracts/dependencies/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xf2efdd01f01f127e8b631675a359cd8cabfbcdcd2e8587ecf906181bcd667bc9\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://e5d8670ec00368fa7ff56ae265337d0b7d454709e639e350e5c9677ae32574ed\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmPRmAmjKkZLatrKjbrj78GqW34b5hwx72WqwoBvyg4QcV\"]},\"v1-migrator/contracts/dependencies/utils/AddressUpgradeable.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xabed77589961adbaaa36817e0914bcbe4c447311c9451bf3fc9b073c1f092d8d\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://9b8f12b15b67cc26a684dc7913e279fe016a0baa44778fa5406e38b17b027b5a\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmejTVV9v4E6WtztCfpbVHDNV8rd2p3qMzrCiBgvTepQby\"]}},\"version\":1}","metadata":{"compiler":{"version":"0.8.26+commit.8a97fa7a"},"language":"Solidity","output":{"abi":[{"inputs":[{"internalType":"uint8","name":"version","type":"uint8","indexed":false}],"type":"event","name":"Initialized","anonymous":false}],"devdoc":{"kind":"dev","methods":{},"version":1},"userdoc":{"kind":"user","methods":{},"version":1}},"settings":{"remappings":["@openzeppelin/=v1-migrator/node_modules/@openzeppelin/"],"optimizer":{"enabled":true,"runs":200},"metadata":{"bytecodeHash":"ipfs"},"compilationTarget":{"v1-migrator/contracts/dependencies/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol":"Initializable"},"evmVersion":"paris","libraries":{}},"sources":{"v1-migrator/contracts/dependencies/proxy/utils/Initializable.sol":{"keccak256":"0xf2efdd01f01f127e8b631675a359cd8cabfbcdcd2e8587ecf906181bcd667bc9","urls":["bzz-raw://e5d8670ec00368fa7ff56ae265337d0b7d454709e639e350e5c9677ae32574ed","dweb:/ipfs/QmPRmAmjKkZLatrKjbrj78GqW34b5hwx72WqwoBvyg4QcV"],"license":"MIT"},"v1-migrator/contracts/dependencies/utils/AddressUpgradeable.sol":{"keccak256":"0xabed77589961adbaaa36817e0914bcbe4c447311c9451bf3fc9b073c1f092d8d","urls":["bzz-raw://9b8f12b15b67cc26a684dc7913e279fe016a0baa44778fa5406e38b17b027b5a","dweb:/ipfs/QmejTVV9v4E6WtztCfpbVHDNV8rd2p3qMzrCiBgvTepQby"],"license":"MIT"}},"version":1},"id":81}
